# Simple Auth

Simple Web API written in Kotlin. Uses Spring Boot and Spring Security to implement user authentication with a 
third-party authentication server (GitHub). GitHub assigns the tokens and identifies the users using OAuth2's
authorization code flow.

GitHub Client ID and Client Secret are not included in the application.yml for security reasons.
